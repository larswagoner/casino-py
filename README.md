# casino python

Terminal based version of the card game casino, played with up to four players. Here is a handy [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrdSVHMYocc). If you would like to read more about the original card game feel free to check out [this article](https://www.britannica.com/topic/casino-card-game).

I was taught how to play this game while floating down the Mekong. A few years later, my friend Max and I decided to program it in Python for fun! The current version works well in the terminal, in the future we might revisit the project to add some graphics.
